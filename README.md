+ make

If GPU-computing enabled, the OpenCL SDK is required for both OS.

## Steps
1. Download zip-archive with source code.
2. Extract the archive.
3. (Only for windows) Open `run.bat` and edit compiler and GNU Make paths if needed.
4. Open `run.bat` file (`run.sh` for Ubuntu) in terminal.
5. Wait for compilation to complete.
6. The Forcell's window should open.
7. Then you can open `Forcell.exe` (`Forcell` for Ubuntu) to run it again.
